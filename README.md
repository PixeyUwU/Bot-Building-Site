# Bot Building Site - Websit

This is the official website for [Bot Building Site](https://discord.gg/2YdFEtKBM5).

## What is Bot Building Site?
**Bot Building Site** is an initiative that was created by Module64 and BBS-Captain. It exists on Discord, and its main purpose is to create bots for people *for free*. Our service exists thanks to the continued support of our clients and developers (shout out to Pixey#2021, DragonRoyal#6969 and BBS-COOL DEV#5366 for their especially continued support of BBS!) Users can contact the admins or developers of Bot Building Site for a bot. They are redirected to our server where they can fill out a form. After that, the developers take a look at their response and begin development if all the information seems right.



#### How was Bot Building Site made?

Bot Building Site was made by BBS-Captain#8920 And Module64#8821
For people that dont know how to code bots it started only with BBS-Captain#8920 And Module64#8821 They made 4-7 bots first then got some devs as showen in the website.

#### Is your service actually free? Is there any catch?
Our service is free, yes. However, there is a catch.

WAIT! Before you click off immediately, hear me out. The catch is a small catch. Our basic plan lets you have __two__ free bots. However, if you upgrade to some of our premium plans, you can gain access to more bots, custom emojis and roles, and more. But our basic plan is completely free and will remain free. With the basic plan, you will also always get user support from our developers.



## Website

Our website is currently still under development, but we are constantly improving it to make it more user-friendly and easier to navigate. If you want to contribute to our initiative, you can do so by supporting our Discord server or helping out with the website by `raising an issue` or creating a `pull request` to work on the code.

Currently, Bot Building Site is running low on available developers. If you are a Discord.js or Discord.py developer (accommodations for other languages are definitely possible), will be available during the 2021-2022 school year for development and are interested in joining Bot Building Site, please consider joining the BBS initiative.

***Note: Please do not copy this code and claim it as your own. Thanks.***
