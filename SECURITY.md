## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you ever find a vulnerability in our website, it is of the upmost importance to not abuse it. **DO *NOT*** *exploit* or *abuse* the vulnerability in any way. Instead, join our Discord server and alert the developers and admins of the server in any reasonable channel by pinging both roles. We will make sure to check the vulnerability.

If your vulnerability report gets declined, we may have a few reasons for that. One is that the report may have been a joke. If this is true, then we will warn you. Another reason why the issue may have been declined is because the vulnerability you found was part of an old version of the website. Since we are pushing fixes to this website, it is highly likely that the vulnerability was spotted in an earlier release and patched.

However, if the vulnerability is accepted, we may cooperate with you to pinpoint the exact place where the issue was found. This is in order to make sure that we can target the cause of the issue and properly diagnose it in order to prevent further damage.

Thank you for your support of BBS.
